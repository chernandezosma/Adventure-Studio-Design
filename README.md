# About Adventure Studio Designer

**Adventure Studio Designer** was born with the idea of giving life back to a type of game that was embraced by an entire generation, conversational adventures. Surely you remember adventures like the [Hobbit](https://bbcmicro.co.uk/jsbeeb/play.php?autoboot&disc=https://bbcmicro.co.uk/gameimg/discs/1681/Disc094-HobbitSTT.ssd&noseek) or those created by the company [Aventuras AD](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aventuras_AD).

Nowadays a very huge of people around the world are creating, playing and distributing this kind of game. In Spain the [CAAD](https://caad.club/) provides news, support, forums and a distributing channel for those people.

I was one of these people who spent a lot of hours playing Conversational Adventures Games and who believe that with the new technologies, we can give a new nut turn to an enhanced Conversational Adventures using voice recognition, text-to-speech for disabled people, videos and animated scenes to recreate a more realistic situation, and as I believe, a channel to tell the History to our descendants and teach them to use the writing, use the imagination, use the intelligence to resolve enigmas, in summary show them a very, although unknown new game type. The Conversational Adventure.

## How to achieve that

I am a normal person, husband, father, grandfather and technology enthusiast. I know  I don't have much free time to develop but I will try to push new features every week.

As you might have deduced, not all of the features listed below will be available immediately, but I will make every effort to implement them over time. 

The plan is to use PHP as the base language for the backend project, and ReactJS for the user interface project. It is probably to use some well-known framework like Laravel or NextJs respectively. The persisting layer will be in charge of the SQLite database to make the project as compact as possible and to reduce the fingerprint in whatever system you want to run it, and finally, the whole system will be deployed as a dockerized version, to make possible the premise of "download-and-play" and to make it easy to deploy to, almost, every operative system in the world.

Sometimes to achieve some features I will base on public libraries, and sometimes in other languages but always with the main goal in mind, provide a good and easy to use product.
